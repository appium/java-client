java-client
===========

Java language binding for writing Appium Tests, conforms to [Mobile JSON Wire Protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/spec-draft.md?repo=mobile)

Depends upon the Selenium Java client library, available [here](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/)

[Download the jar from Maven](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.appium%22%20AND%20a%3A%22java-client%22) or add the following to pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

It currently depends on selenium-java 2.46.0. If it is necessary to use another version of Selenium then you can configure pom.xml as follows:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>2.2.0</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
      <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
  <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
  <version>${selenium.version.you.require}</version>
</dependency>
```

###Structure###

There is an abstract _AppiumDriver_ class which inherits from the Selenium Java Client.
The _AppiumDriver_ class contains all methods shared by iOS and Android.
_IOSDriver_ and _AndroidDriver_ both extend _AppiumDriver_ and provide more methods, and specific implementations for some methods.

###Added functions###
More can be found in the docs, but here's a quick list of features which this project has added to the usual selenium binding.

##Changelog##

*2.2.0*
- Added new TouchAction methods for LongPress, on an element, at x,y coordinates, or at an offset from within an element
- SwipeElementDirection changed. Read the documentation, it's now smarter about how/where to swipe
- Added APPIUM_VERSION MobileCapabilityType
- `sendKeyEvent()` moved from AppiumDriver to AndroidDriver
- `linkText` and `partialLinkText` locators added
- setValue() moved from MobileElement to AndroidElement
- Fixed Selendroid PageAnnotations

*2.1.0*
- Moved hasAppString() from AndroidDriver to AppiumDriver
- Fixes to PageFactory
- Added @AndroidFindAll and @iOSFindAll
- Added toggleLocationServices() to AndroidDriver
- Added touchAction methods to MobileElement, so now you can do `element.pinch()`, `element.zoom()`, etc.
- Added the ability to choose a direction to swipe over an element. Use the `SwipeElementDirection` enums: `UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT`

*2.0.0*
- AppiumDriver is now an abstract class, use IOSDriver and AndroidDriver which both extend it. You no longer need to include the `PLATFORM_NAME` desired capability since it's automatic for each class. Thanks to @TikhomirovSergey for all their work
- ScrollTo() and ScrollToExact() methods reimplemented
- Zoom() and Pinch() are now a little smarter and less likely to fail if you element is near the edge of the screen. Congratulate @BJap on their first PR!

*1.7.0*
- Removed `scrollTo()` and `scrollToExact()` methods because they relied on `complexFind()`. They will be added back in the next version!
- Removed `complexFind()`
- Added `startActivity()` method
- Added `isLocked()` method
- Added `getSettings()` and `ignoreUnimportantViews()` methods

*1.6.2*
- Added MobilePlatform interface (Android, IOS, FirefoxOS)
- Added MobileBrowserType interface (Safari, Browser, Chromium, Chrome)
- Added MobileCapabilityType.APP_WAIT_ACTIVITY
- Fixed small Integer cast issue (in Eclipse it won't compile)
- Set -source and -target of the Java Compiler to 1.7 (for maven compiler plugin)
- Fixed bug in Page Factory

*1.6.1*
- Fixed the logic for checking connection status on NetworkConnectionSetting objects

*1.6.0*
- Added @findBy annotations. Explanation here: https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/68 Thanks to TikhomirovSergey
- Appium Driver now implements LocationContext interface, so setLocation() works for setting GPS coordinates

*1.5.0*
- Added MobileCapabilityType enums for desired capabilities
- `findElement` and `findElements` return MobileElement objects (still need to be casted, but no longer instantiated)
- new appium v1.2 `hideKeyboard()` strategies added
- `getNetworkConnection()` and `setNetworkConnection()` commands added

*1.4.0*
- Added openNotifications() method, to open the notifications shade on Android
- Added pullFolder() method, to pull an entire folder as a zip archive from a device/simulator
- Upgraded Selenium dependency to 2.42.2

*1.3.0*
- MultiGesture with a single TouchAction fixed for Android
- Now depends upon Selenium java client 2.42.1
- Cleanup of Errorcode handling, due to merging a change into Selenium

*1.2.1*
- fix dependency issue

*1.2.0*
- complexFind() now returns MobileElement objects
- added scrollTo() and scrollToExact() methods for use with complexFind()

*1.1.0*
- AppiumDriver now implements Rotatable. rotate() and getOrientation() methods added
- when no appium server is running, the proper error is thrown, instead of a NullPointerException

*1.0.2*
- recompiled to include some missing methods such as shake() and complexFind()
