java-client
===========

Java language binding for writing Appium Tests, conforms to [Mobile JSON Wire Protocol](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/mobile-spec/blob/master/spec-draft.md)

Depends upon the Selenium Java client library, available [here](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/)

[Download the jar from Maven](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.appium%22%20AND%20a%3A%22java-client%22) or add the following to pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.1</version>
</dependency>
```

It currently depends on selenium-java 2.53.0. If it is necessary to use another version of Selenium then you can configure pom.xml as follows:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.1</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
      <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
  <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
  <version>${selenium.version.you.require}</version>
</dependency>
```

###Structure###

There is an abstract _AppiumDriver_ class which inherits from the Selenium Java Client.
The _AppiumDriver_ class contains all methods shared by iOS and Android.
_IOSDriver_ and _AndroidDriver_ both extend _AppiumDriver_ and provide more methods, and specific implementations for some methods.

In the same way, _IOSElement_ and _AndroidElement_ both are subclasses of _MobileElement_

You can instantiate and AppiumDriver with the class of element you want commands to return. For example
`AppiumDriver<MobileElement> driver;`
and now when you call the Find functions, they return elements of class MobileElement.
You can also instantiate drivers like this, to make things simpler:
`AndroidDriver<AndroidElement> driver = new AndroidDriver(.......`
`IOSElement el = driver.findElementByAccessiblityId('sample');`

##Changelog##
*4.0.0 (under construction yet)*
- all code marked `@Deprecated` was removed. Java client won't support old servers (v<1.5.0)
anymore.
- the searching for elements by nspredicate string was added. It requires the [XCUITest mode](https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/docs/Installing-xcuitest-driver.md). Thanks to [@rafael-chavez](https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/352) for the contribution
- the ability to start an activity using Android intent actions, intent categories, flags and arguments
was added to `AndroidDriver`. Thanks to [@saikrishna321](https://github.com/saikrishna321) for the contribution.
- `scrollTo()` and `scrollToExact()` became deprecated. They are going to be removed in the next release.
- the `io.appium.java_client.NetworkConnectionSetting` class was marked deprecated
- the enum `io.appium.java_client.android.Connection` was added. All supported network bitmasks are defined there.
- Android. Old methods which get/set connection were marked  `@Deprecated`
- Android. New methods which consume/return `io.appium.java_client.android.Connection` were added.
- the `nsPredicate` parameter was added to the `iOSFindBy` annotation
- the `commandRepository` field is public now. The modification of the `MobileCommand`
- The refactoring of `io.appium.java_client.internal.JsonToMobileElementConverter`. Now it accepts 
`org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver` as the constructor parameter. It is possible to re-use 
`io.appium.java_client.android.internal.JsonToAndroidElementConverter` or 
`io.appium.java_client.ios.internal.JsonToIOSElementConverter` by RemoteWebDriver when it is needed.
- Constructors of the abstract `io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver` were redesigned. Now they require 
a subclass of `io.appium.java_client.internal.JsonToMobileElementConverter`. Constructors of 
`io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver` and `io.appium.java_client.ios.IOSDriver` are same still.
- The `pushFile(String remotePath, File file)` was added to AndroidDriver
- FIX of TouchAction. Instances of the TouchAction class are reusable now
- FIX of the swiping issue (iOS, server version >= 1.5.0). Now the swiping is implemented differently by 
AndroidDriver and IOSDriver. Thanks to [@truebit](https://github.com/truebit) and [@nuggit32](https://github.com/nuggit32) for the catching.
- the project was integrated with [maven-checkstyle-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/). Thanks to [@SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget) for the work
- source code was improved according to code style checking rules. 
- the integration with `org.owasp dependency-check-maven` was added. Thanks to [@saikrishna321](https://github.com/saikrishna321) 
for the work.
- the integration with `org.jacoco jacoco-maven-plugin` was added. Thanks to [@SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget) for the contribution.

Server flags were added:
  - GeneralServerFlag.ASYNC_TRACE
  - IOSServerFlag.WEBKIT_DEBUG_PROXY_PORT
- Source code was formatted using [eclipse-java-google-style.xml](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eclipse-java-google-style.xml). This is not the complete solution. The code style checking is going to be added further. Thanks to [SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget) for the work!

*3.4.0*
- Update to Selenium v2.52.0
- `getAppStrings()` methods are deprecated now. They are going to be removed. `getAppStringMap()` methods were added and now return a map with app strings (keys and values)

- `getDeviceTime()` was added. Thanks to [@SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget) for the contribution.
- FIXED `longPressKeyCode()` methods. Now they use the convenient JSONWP command.Thanks to [@kirillbilchenko](https://github.com/kirillbilchenko) for the proposed fix.
- FIXED javadoc.
- Page object tools were updated. Details read here: [#311](https://github.com/appium/java-client/issues/311), [#313](https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/313), [#317](https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/317). By.name locator strategy is deprecated for Android and iOS. It is still valid for the Selendroid mode. Thanks to [@SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget) for the helping.
- The method `lockScreen(seconds)` is deprecated and it is going to be removed in the next release. Since Appium node server v1.5.x it is recommended to use
`AndroidDriver.lockDevice()...AndroidDriver.unlockDevice()` or `IOSDriver.lockDevice(int seconds)` instead. Thanks to [@namannigam](https://github.com/namannigam) for
the catching. Read [#315](https://github.com/appium/java-client/issues/315)

Thanks to [SergeyErmakovMercDev](https://github.com/SergeyErmakovMercDev) for the reporting.
- all capabilities were added according to [this description](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/1.5/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md). There are three classes: `io.appium.java_client.remote.MobileCapabilityType` (just modified), `io.appium.java_client.remote.AndroidMobileCapabilityType` (android-specific capabilities), `io.appium.java_client.remote.IOSMobileCapabilityType` (iOS-specific capabilities). Details are here: [#326](https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/326)
- some server flags were marked `deprecated` because they are deprecated since server node v1.5.x. These flags are going to be removed at the java client release. Details are here: [#326](https://github.com/appium/java-client/pull/326)
