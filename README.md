This is the Java language binding for writing Appium Tests, conforms to [Mobile JSON Wire Protocol](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/mobile-spec/blob/master/spec-draft.md)

[How to install it and to use it](https://github.com/appium/java-client/blob/master/docs/Installing-the-project.md)

[API docs](http://appium.github.io/java-client/)

###Structure###

There is an abstract `io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver` class which extends `org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver` 
from the Selenium Java Client. The `io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver` class contains all methods shared by iOS and Android.
`io.appium.java_client.ios.IOSDriver` and `io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver` both extend `io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver` 
and provide more methods, and specific implementations for some methods.

In the same way, `io.appium.java_client.ios.IOSElement` and `io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidElement` both are subclasses of 
`io.appium.java_client.MobileElement`

*4.0.0*
- all code marked `@Deprecated` was removed. Java client won't support old servers (v<1.5.0)
anymore.

was added to `AndroidDriver`. Thanks to [@saikrishna321](https://github.com/saikrishna321) for the contribution.
- `scrollTo()` and `scrollToExact()` became deprecated. They are going to be removed in the next release.

deprecated as well. They are going to be removed in the next release.
- Methods `findElements(String by, String using)` and `findElement(String by, String using)` of `org.openga.selenium.remote.RemoteWebdriver` are public now. Thanks to [@SrinivasanTarget](https://github.com/SrinivasanTarget).
- the `io.appium.java_client.NetworkConnectionSetting` class was marked deprecated

`io.appium.java_client.ios.internal.JsonToIOSElementConverter` by RemoteWebDriver when it is needed.
- Constructors of the abstract `io.appium.java_client.AppiumDriver` were redesigned. Now they require 
a subclass of `io.appium.java_client.internal.JsonToMobileElementConverter`. Constructors of 
`io.appium.java_client.android.AndroidDriver` and `io.appium.java_client.ios.IOSDriver` are same still.
- The `pushFile(String remotePath, File file)` was added to AndroidDriver
